Flicker Platform
======
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PERSISTLab/mayfly-lang/master/media/logo.png" width="128" style="float: left;"> This repository hosts the Flicker platform acompanying the paper titled [*Flicker: Rapid Prototyping for the Batteryless Internet-of-Things*](http://josiahhester.com/cv/files/flickersensys.pdf) in the 15th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems [(SenSys 2017)](http://sensys.acm.org/2017/).

This project is part of an ongoing collaboration between Clemson University and Northwestern University, originally initiated at Clemson under Prof. Jacob Sorber, with Josiah Hester.

## Setup and Usage

Coming soon! Right now we are working on a way to get hardware to people, please contact the authors for more information. For now, feel free to explore the hardware designs or even order your own from Macrofab or Circutihub.

## Contributors

- Diana Zhang and  Tamara Ortega contributed early on to the Flicker hardware designs for an REU in the summer of 2014.
- [Prof. Josiah Hester](http://josiahhester.com/cv/) guided the early effort and continued on after summer as a graduate student in the PERSIST Lab, implementing the compiler and supporting systems. Prof. Hester continues this work at Northwestern University.
- [Prof. Jacob Sorber](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jsorber/) oversaw, funded, and originated the project.
